**Introduction:**
Understanding the factors influencing inflation is crucial for policymakers, economists, and investors. In this study, we employ a regression analysis to explore the impact of various macroeconomic variables on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). 

**MODELS**

**Multi Linear Regression Model:**
The regression equation used in this analysis is:

CPI=β0​+β1​×M1+β2​×M2+β3​×Unemployment Rate+β4​×PCE+β5​×DSPI+β6​×Federal Funds Rate+β7​×Industrial Production Index+ϵ

Where:

    CPI is the Consumer Price Index, representing the overall price level of a basket of goods and services.
    
    M1 and M2 are measures of the money supply, capturing different components of liquid assets in the economy.
    
    Unemployment Rate Rate reflects the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed, serving as an indicator of economic health.
    
    PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) accounts for the expenditures by individuals and is a key component of GDP.
    
    DSPI (Disposable Personal Income) measures the after-tax income available to individuals for spending and saving.
    
    Federal Funds Rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions lend funds to each other overnight, set by the Federal Reserve.
    
    Industrial Production Index represents the output of the industrial sector, indicating economic activity.
